      <p>The last time I made this mini chocolate cake for two, we ate it in the car on the way to dinner. And if I remember correctly, we had burgers and fries.

It’s not that this cake is ‘light’ or ‘not too sweet’ or whatever it is that people say about dessert to make them feel less badly about eating it. It’s a solid, rich chocolate cake.

The cake has a crumb that is one notch closer to pound cake than boxed cake mix, which I love. </p>
